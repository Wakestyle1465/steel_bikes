            The company was founded in 1974 by Mike Sinyard, a cycling enthusiast who sold his Volkswagen Bus for $1,500 to fund a cycle tour of Europe, where he bought handlebars and stems made by Cinelli to take back to the US. Sinyard started importing Italian bike components that were difficult to find in the United States, but the company began to produce its own bike parts by 1976, starting with the Steel Touring Tire. In 1981, the company introduced its first two bikes, the Sequoia, a sport-touring design and the Allez, a road bike. Steel also introduced the first major production mountain bike in the world, the Stumpjumper, in 1981. Like the Sequoia and Allez, the Stumpjumper was designed by Tim Neenan and based on an early Tom Ritchey design. Steel continues to produce bikes under the Stumpjumper name, including both hardtail and full-suspension models. An original Stumpjumper is displayed in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. In 1989, Steel introduced the Epic, the world's second mass-production carbon fiber mountain bike.

            In the early 1990s, Steel introduced the Globe range of urban bikes; it had a major relaunch in 2009, which saw Globe become its own distinct brand. The Globe brand has since been discontinued, and Steel now markets "lifestyle" bikes under its main brand.

            In 1995, Steel launched the Full Force brand. Full Force was a lower-end mountain bike brand sold through sporting goods stores and discount retailers such as Costco. The move angered some Steel dealers. In 1996, Steel withdrew the Full Force line and Mike Sinyard wrote a letter of apology to dealers.By the end of 1996, Specialized had lost 30% of its bike shop sales and, according to Sinyard, "came within a few hundred dollars of declaring bankruptcy".

            In 2001, Merida Bikes of Taiwan bought 49% of Specialized (initially reported as 19%) for a reported US$30 million. Mike Sinyard remained majority owner and CEO of the company. As of 2016, Steel is one of the biggest bicycle brands operating in the United States, alongside Trek Bicycle Corporation and Giantteel

            In 2012, Steel issued a recall for about 12,000 bicycles sold through retailers from 2007 until July 2012 due to a faulty front fork. Recalled models include the company's Globe products.
